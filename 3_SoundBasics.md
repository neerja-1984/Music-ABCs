## Understand synth :

--------------------

## Amplitude :

- more amplitude : loud sound
- less amplitude : soft ( less ) sound
- volume up / down button on mobile : controls amplitude

--------------------

## Pitch :

- higher pitch : higher sound ( keys in right side of piano)
- lower pitch : lower sound ( keys in left side of piano ) 

### hence high pitch + high amplitude == too high sound (clash)
### hence low pitch + low amplitude == too low sound (silence)

------------

## Synthesizers::

- physical synthesizers : instruments which emit sound ( when banged / string plucked / key pressed)
- software synthesizers : computer programs which can generate sound based on a variety of parameters
- a same synth ( both software / instrument ) can sound like many differen things like ( drums / strings / sirens / alarms)
------------

## Brightness :

- higher brightness : brighter sound ( feels like a image with high contrast / sharp)
- lower brightness : dimmer sound ( feels like blurred sound )
- similar to a brightness control button on mobile : controls brightness

----------

## Movement :

- higher movement : faster sound
- lower movement : slower sound
- similar to a movement control button on mobile : controls movement

--------------------

## Envelope :

- shape of sound changing over time 
- as shape changes .. variables change as well . like pitch + amplitude 
- as `envelope changes the sound -> we also call envelope as MODULATION`
- Most synthesizers have envelopes with four sections or stages, called attack, decay, sustain, and release. 
- You'll often see these abbreviated as `ADSR`

    ## attack :
    - the shortest part, when the sound is first made
    - attack control determines how long it takes for the envelope to reach its peak at the start of a note.
    - pitch picks up and goes higher
    - ![alt text](image-1.png)

    ## decay :
    - the part where the sound falls off
    - how long it takes for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level
    - opposite to attack
    - pitch decreases
    - ![alt text](image.png)

    ## sustain :
    - the part where the sound is kept at the same volume
    - pitch remains constant
    - `if sustain == up ( its max value == pitch is highets value == no use of decay  )


    ## release :
    - the longest part, when the sound dies away
    - elease control determines how long it takes for the envelope to decrease to its minimum level after the note is released
    - pitch goes down .. min then 0


- in simple terms -> when a note is pressed 
- attack : pitch will always reach its highest value
- decay : how long it takes for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level
- sustain : the part where the note is kept at the same volume
- release : pitch will always reach its lowest value .. min then 0
- `attack -> ( deacay/sustain) -> release`

- `Envelopes not only change pitch but also amplitude`

-----------------

## Oscialltors ( LFOs == Low frequency Oscialltors): 

- synthesizers use oscillators insted of envelopes for MODULATION 
- repeating back n forth == oscialltion
-----------

## ( LFOs == Low frequency Oscialltors): 

- LFOS mosulate modulate pitch 
- what is `LFO amount` ?
- the shape of LFO == `WAVE`
- eg : `SINE , SQUARE , SAW` waves
- emit very low freq to add disturbances in a signal
- when `LFO + pitch` == `vibrato`
- when `LFO + AMPLITUDE` == `tremolo`
- so they act as control signal. 
----------------------------

## Frequency  -> direct relation to pitch 
- inverse to time 
- low freq (low hertz) == more time to change Pitch
- high freq (high hertz) == very quick change in pitch
- hence oscilation is related to freq 
    - more freq == more oscilation ( faster ) == high pitch
    - less freq == less oscilation ( slower ) == low pitch
    - think of a car engine 
        - leg on accelerator == rpm inc == more energy ( more noise from engine)
        - leg off accelerator == rpm dec == less energy ( less noise from engine)

------------------------

## Audio Oscillators :

- produce sounds in synths ( which goes throught the above ops ... and gets modulated)
- different shapes of waves -> different timbres 

--------------------------

## study what are timbres 

## study what are pulse widths
